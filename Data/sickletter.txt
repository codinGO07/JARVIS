Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am not feeling well and will not be able to come to work today, [Date]. I woke up this morning with [describe your symptoms briefly, e.g., a high fever, severe headache, and sore throat]. I believe it is best for both my health and the health of others that I take the day off to rest and recover.

I understand the importance of my responsibilities at work and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I will ensure that my tasks are up to date before I leave and will delegate any urgent tasks to a colleague if necessary. I will also be reachable via email or phone for any emergencies.

I will keep you updated about my health and will let you know if I need to extend my sick leave. I expect to be back at work on [expected return date], assuming I feel better by then.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,
